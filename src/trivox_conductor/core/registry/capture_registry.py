"""
Capture Adapter Registry
=======================

Role-specific registry for :class:`~trivox_conductor.core.contracts.capture.CaptureAdapter`
implementations. Provides selection of an **active** adapter and lazy instantiation.

Features
--------
- **Typed isolation**: Only classes deriving from ``CaptureAdapter`` can be registered.
- **Active selection**: ``set_active(name)`` pins the implementation to use.
- **Lazy instantiation**: ``get_active()`` creates and caches one instance of the active class.
- **Safe switching**: Changing the active name clears the cached instance.

Lifecycle
---------
Adapters are typically registered during app/plugin initialization (e.g., by
loading ``plugin.yaml`` descriptors). Services then call ``get_active()`` to
retrieve the singleton instance for the current process.

Errors
------
- ``KeyError`` when setting an unknown adapter name.
- ``None`` returned by ``get_active()`` if no active adapter has been selected.
