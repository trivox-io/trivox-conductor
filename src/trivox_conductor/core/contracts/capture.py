"""
Capture Role Contract
=====================

Defines the minimal interface for **capture** adapters (e.g., OBS, in-game,
or virtual recorders). Implementations are responsible for *I/O* and system
integration; higher-level orchestration lives in services.

Required Capabilities
---------------------
- **Discovery**: ``list_scenes()``, ``list_profiles()``
- **Selection**: ``select_scene(name)``, ``select_profile(name)``
- **Lifecycle**: ``start_capture()``, ``stop_capture()``
- **Status**: ``is_recording() -> bool``

Notes
-----
- Implementations should be **idempotent** where practical (e.g., stopping when
  already stopped).
- Prefer raising ``RuntimeError`` with actionable messages rather than leaking
  SDK-specific exceptions.
- Keep network/process I/O inside the adapter; do not load global settings hereâ€”use
  ``configure(settings, secrets)`` invoked by the calling service.
